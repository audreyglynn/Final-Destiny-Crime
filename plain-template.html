      <p class="deck"> After COVID-19 caused crime to decline between 2020 and 2022, the eighth largest mall in America is facing an increase with the withering of the pandemic and changes in national attitudes towards police.</p>

        <p> As the COVID-19 pandemic is slowly dissipating, Destiny USA in Syracuse, New York is beginning to see an increase in criminal activity.   </p>
        <p> Destiny USA, the largest mall in New York and eighth in the country, is one of the most popular attractions in Syracuse and a major part of marketing the city to potential visitors. Plastered on most pages of the <a href=https://www.visitsyracuse.com/> VisitSyracuse website</a>, it includes over 250 different places to dine, shop and entertain. </p>
        <p>According to the <a href=https://www.destinyusa.com/> mall’s website</a>, it attracts over 25 million visitors each year. Something that is ultimately inevitable with such a crowd will always be crime.  </p>
        <p>
        But when COVID-19 struck the mall in 2020, crime only decreased because the mall was not open. An executive order by Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon closed the mall on March 18, 2020, and the mall did not see customers until early July, a few months later. Even then, customers were limited and many stores remained closed.</p>
        <p>Even so, Destiny USA is Syracuse’s most crime-ridden spot year in and year out. While some of those crimes are lower-concern such as shoplifting, Destiny has not been exempt from violent threats and activity. Syracuse Police saw that the pandemic had effects on the city’s crime rate as a whole as well. </p>
        <p>““We saw a decline in crime, originally because people just weren’t going out, and then we saw a pretty dramatic rise,” said Lieutenant Matthew Malinowski.</p>
        <p>Lt. Malinowski, the Syracuse Police Department’s Office of Public Relations supervisor, believes crime was bound to rise when the state’s government slowly allowed people back into the public. He said SPD is fully aware that Destiny’s crime decrease had more to do with the pandemic than anything else.</p>
        <p>“COVID-19 was a significant factor in decreased crime, there was a time when people couldn’t even go to the mall and then a limited amount of people could.”</p>
        <p>But three years later, mask mandates are long gone, and capacity limits disappeared with them. Destiny USA is back to the place it was when 2020 first began. Full of people dining, shopping and playing. But something else falling into a similar trend of pre-COVID-19 Destiny is crime rates at the mall.</p>

           <div class="first-viz"><iframe title="Criminal Offenses Reported at Destiny USA" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-AMfOz" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AMfOz/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></div>
        <p> Steadily, but surely, crime is increasing at Destiny in 2023. 2021 was low for crime in the recent five years at the mall in its first four months with some COVID-19 restrictions still intact. The following year was only a subtle rise. But the criminal offenses at the mall reported in 2023’s first four months are reaching similar numbers to those before the pandemic.</p>
        <p> “I think it also ties into some of these criminal justice reforms, where you have larceny and criminal mischief and small-level offenses that aren’t getting the harshest punishments,” said Lt. Malinowski.</p>
        <p>Something else that created headlines in 2020 was the #BlackLivesMatter movement, causing protests across the nation, including Syracuse. The movement is calling for changes in how police react in criminal encounters, potentially causing changes in how police react to crime recently, whether it be the small-level offenses at Destiny or larger-scale ones throughout the city. </p>
                <div><iframe title="Percentages of Arrests Made at Destiny USA" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-w3FdL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/w3FdL/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
              </script></div>
        <p> With crime being up and arrest rates being down in the same year, it suggests new limitations on Syracuse Police and how they can respond to crime, even if it is as simple as a shoplift. Meanwhile, nothing has changed about Syracuse police’s presence at the mall. In fact, Lt. Malinowski said the relationship between the mall and SPD is strong, and they are taking thorough action to address the crime.</p>
         <p> “I can say that the mall and the department have a great relationship. We have cops on the property every day, and we even have an office there if we have to make an arrest. The mall is making enhancements to the mall security officers, there are cameras, and they keep installing new cameras on the property. For us, we make sure we are on the premise seven days a week staying as visible as possible. Security has fixed posts. Those are a few of the things we have to try to keep crime down there.”</p>
         <p>So, with all that is being done to monitor the mall and crime that is beginning to increase, arrests being down makes little sense, especially with recent violent activity at Destiny. But Lt. Malinowski revealed SPD’s biggest issue at the mall lies within Syracuse’s younger community. </p>
         <p>“You’re not allowed to have juveniles in there alone. So, if you’re 17 and under, you can’t be in there by yourself,” said Lt. Malinowski. “So, parents need to make sure that they’re not letting their kids go to the mall unattended because that is actually one of the things we have the biggest problem with, juveniles.”</p>
         <p>In March of this year, a 14-year-old boy was arrested after firing a gun at a trash can at the mall. Just a few months prior, Juli Boeheim, one of Syracuse’s most prominent figures, was robbed at gunpoint in Destiny’s parking lot by a 12-year-old.</p>
         <p>Many protocols exist in responding to young criminals and Syracuse Police and Destiny continue to struggle in dealing with juveniles that are at the mall. Violent crimes such as armed robberies do not occur at the mall every day and the likelihood of such prominence is low. But as national recognition of police’s reaction during criminal activity increases and COVID-19’s impact on Syracuse’s public turnout decreases, it is important for Destiny shoppers to recognize anyone has the chance to commit a crime, even children.</p>
         <p>“You have a relatively low chance of being a victim of a crime. But anything can happen. You can’t be afraid to leave your house. You just have to take a few steps to be proactive and just be aware of your surroundings,” said Lt. Malinowski. “Have your head on a swivel, do not get caught on your phone, and do not leave your vehicle unlocked. It is some common sense things.”</p>
